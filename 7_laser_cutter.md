## Laser cut pieces

Using rasp pi specs I designed the case on the mm exact. Using inkscape. See specs/...pdf.
My design pi_case/case_design_pi3.svg

With M2 screws (just long enough) and some straws, I put the pi floating between 2 pieces of wood.
The prototype board glued on with a glue-gun.

Strips, 12 mm wide and 54 cm long. All with rounded corners, not to break the fabric. The strips give a bit of extra strength to the strips and the soldered connections. Because the leds are not made for wearable uses. Anyways, defining againts all odds, I managed :)
