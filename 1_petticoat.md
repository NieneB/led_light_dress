# Making a Petticoat!

Ordered Tule and Organza. 

6 layers made out of:
	
	* Tule Circle skirt 25cm 
	* Tule Strip 30 cm x 500 cm
	* Decoration ruffle strip(3 diff colours): 750cm x 10cm

First cut all coloured strips and hemmed them with a hemming foot on my sewing machine. So 6 x 7,5 meters! 

Then cut the tule strips. 6 x 5 meter. 25cm wide.
and 6 x circle skirt 25 wide. Diameter of 75cm. Inner circle diameter of 25cm. For my taille circumference is 76cm. `76 / pi = 24.2cm` 
The outer circumference becomes `75 * pi = 235cm`

Then attached the coloured organza strips to the tule strip. Then the tule strip to the circle skirt. 

I cut a 15 cm opening in the circle skirts so I can slip it over my hips. 
Hip circumference is 105 cm. So `105-76 = 29` Needing a cut of `29/2 = 14.5cm`.

The I sewed them all together at the top. 


## Things I learned:

* Using a hemming foot on my sewing machine. I experimented but making a flat hem was too difficult with the thin organza fabric. But using the a zig-zag steek it turned out to be more easy and it gave a beautiful round hem! Still having some silver glitter decoration thread it gave a nice look.
* Calculating fabric need in front. Though I failed this time. Ordered way to much Tule and too less coloured organza. The ruffles would have been nicer if I could have made them longer 10m instead of 7.5m. I could have made them thinner and then longer. so 7.5 cm wide by 10m instead of 10cm by 7.5m. But I was afraid they would become too thin, by hemming them and needing a hem to attach them to the tule strip. Now, I ended up with 7cm wide ruffles after hemming and attaching them.  
* Ordering the right amount of fabric also needs the design to be set and ready. I couldn't make up my mind about the final dress design, plus this also depended on the LED strip possibilities and restrictions. Without having any experience with LED strips I needed to do this project in cycles. Making part of the dress, making part of the LED strips, adjusting the design of the dress to the LED strip restrictions, making the dress, integrating the final LED design.
