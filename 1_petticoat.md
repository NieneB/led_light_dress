# Making a Petticoat!

Ordered Tule and Organza. 

6 layers made out of:
	
	* Tule Circle skirt 25cm 
	* Tule Strip 30 cm x 500 cm
	* Decoration ruffle strip(3 diff colours): 750cm x 10cm

First cut all coloured strips and hemmed them with a hemming foot on my sewing machine. So 6 x 7,5 meters! 

Then cut the tule strips. 6 x 5 meter. 25cm wide.
and 6 x circle skirt 25 wide. Diameter of 75cm. Inner circle diameter of 25cm. For my taille circumference is 76cm. `76 / pi = 24.2cm` 
The outer circumference becomes `75 * pi = 235cm`

Then attached the coloured organza strips to the tule strip. Then the tule strip to the circle skirt. 

I cut a 15 cm opening in the circle skirts so I can slip it over my hips. 
Hip circumference is 105 cm. So `105-76 = 29` Needing a cut of `29/2 = 14.5cm`.

The I sewed them all together at the top.
