## Making dress layers

In total the dress has 4 layers on top of the petticoat. I also added one lining layer underneath the petty coat. 

From bottom to top:

| layer | circle skirt 	| length 	| color | circ waist | diameter | radius |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|------------| -------- |--------|
| 1 	| full 			| 55 cm		| pink	| 79cm  	 | 25.15 	| 12.6   |
| 2		| 1.3 			| 50 cm 	| white | 26.33 	 | - 		| 		 | * usd full pattern
| 3		| double 		| 40 cm 	| white | 39.5  	 | 12.6 	| 6.3    |
| 4		| 4 			| 30 cm		| white | 19.75 	 | 6.2 		| 3.15   |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|------------|----------|--------|

Hemmed everything with pink thread.

Choices are based on the amount of fabric I had available... Becuase my idea changed a lot and I coudn't make up my mind I just started and ended up with these layers! I did planned a lot, calculated which amount of fabric I would need but it just turned out to be different.
